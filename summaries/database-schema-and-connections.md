# Database schema & connections — onboarding guide

MedFlowAI stores **family appointments**, **prep checklists**, and **who may use the app** in a single **PostgreSQL** database. The schema is intentionally small: one row per family member for identity, an optional login row, and shared calendar data everyone trusts.

This post explains **what each table is for**, **how they connect**, and **how WhatsApp, the web app, and environment variables** all touch the same data.

**Takeaway:** Almost all “who is this person?” data lives on **`FamilyMember`**. **`User`** only adds a password for the website. **`Appointment`** is the shared family calendar.

    string senderWaId UK "phone, not FK"
    string kind "cancel | awaitTime"
    string appointmentId
    string summary

  }
```

`ConversationTurn` and `PendingAction` are **standalone** (no foreign keys) — they key off the raw WhatsApp sender phone (`senderWaId`), so they work even before someone registers, and a vanished member never orphans rows.

## Table-by-table

### `FamilyMember` — the family roster

One row = **one person** the product recognizes by phone.

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `phoneNumber` | Canonical ID for WhatsApp + login (always `972…`, no `+`) |
| `displayName` | Hebrew name shown in UI and AI prompts (e.g. סתיו, אבא) |
| `gender` | Used for Hebrew verb agreement (שירי **תסיע** vs עדי **יסיע**) |

**Who writes here?**

- **Register** — the primary source of `displayName` / `gender`: the signup form's "שם" writes straight to `FamilyMember`.
- **`npm run prisma:seed`** — ensures a row exists per allowlisted phone; only sets `displayName` / `gender` when the env entry actually supplies them (`phone:שם:gender`), and never clobbers an existing name with the phone placeholder.
- **One-time SQL** — `scripts/seed-family-allowlist.sql` for backfilling names on legacy placeholder rows.

**Who reads here?**

- **WhatsApp allowlist** — `FamilyMemberService.isAllowed(phone)` (+ env fallback).
- **AI personas** — `FamilyPersonaService` builds the “known family” block for prompts.
- **Auth responses** — API still returns `name`, `phoneNumber`, `gender` to the SPA, joined from `FamilyMember`.

There is **no separate `AllowedPhone` table** anymore; that was merged into `FamilyMember`.

---

### `User` — web login only

A `User` row exists **only after הרשמה (registration)**. It does **not** duplicate phone, name, or gender.

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `familyMemberId` | Required link to exactly one `FamilyMember` |
| `passwordHash` | bcrypt hash; never sent to the client |
| `role` | Optional string for future admin/coordinator ideas |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph before [Before register]
    FM1[FamilyMember\nphone + name + gender]
  end

  subgraph after [After register]
    FM2[FamilyMember]
    U[User\npassword only]
    FM2 --- U
  end

  before -->|"הרשמה + password"| after
```

**WhatsApp without register:** A family member can message **חנטריש** as soon as they exist in `FamilyMember` (or env allowlist). No `User` row required.

**Cascade:** Deleting a `FamilyMember` deletes their `User` (if any).

---

### `Appointment` — shared calendar

Core fields: `title`, `dateTime`, `timeKnown`, `location`, `notes`.

`timeKnown` records whether the **hour is real**. `dateTime` is always a full timestamp, but when someone books a date without a time (common on WhatsApp), we still must store *some* instant — so we anchor it to local noon and set `timeKnown = false`. This keeps a genuine 12:00 appointment (`timeKnown = true`) distinct from "time not set yet". Every display and the AI grounding read this flag: when it's `false` they show the date only and never assert or "correct" an hour. Web/API creates default to `true` (their picker always includes a time); the WhatsApp create sets it from what was actually said and then asks for the missing hour.

| Relation | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `transportUserId` → `User` | Registered driver linked by account (e.g. שירי logged in) |
| `transportNotes` | Free text: מונית, תחזיר, times, etc. |
| `responsibleUserId` → `User` | Optional “אחראי” on the web calendar |

Transport display merges **linked user’s** `FamilyMember.displayName` + `gender` with `transportNotes`. If the driver never registered, WhatsApp may store everything in `transportNotes` only.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  APT[Appointment]
  TU[User transportUser]
  FM[FamilyMember via User]
  APT -->|transportUserId| TU
  TU --> FM
  APT -->|transportNotes| TXT[Hebrew line in UI / WhatsApp]
  FM --> TXT
```

Times are stored in **UTC**; Hebrew formatting uses `Asia/Jerusalem` in `appointment-datetime.ts`.

---

### `Requirement` — per-appointment checklist

Small tasks tied to one appointment (`description`, `isDone`). Shown in the SPA and included in AI “facts” for grounded Q&A.

---

### `MedicalDocument` — file metadata

Stores `fileUrl` + `notes` + who uploaded (`uploadedByUserId` → `User`). Optional link to an appointment. (Upload pipeline depends on how you host files; the DB only holds references.)

---

### `PasswordResetToken` — forgot-password codes

Short-lived rows with hashed 6-digit codes, sent via WhatsApp OTP flow. Deleted after successful reset.

---

### `ConversationTurn` — short-term WhatsApp memory

One row per message in a 1:1 chat (`role` = `user` | `assistant`, plus `text`). `ConversationService` reads the last ~10 recent turns and threads them into the grounded Q&A LLM call so follow-ups like "ומה עם הבא?" make sense.

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `senderWaId` | WhatsApp phone (the "conversation key", not a FK) |
| `role` | `user` or `assistant` |
| `text` | Raw message text |

**Bloat control:** turns are pruned on every write (TTL + per-sender cap) and a daily `@Cron` sweep deletes anything stale, so this table stays tiny. Indexed on `(senderWaId, createdAt)` for fast recent-turn reads.

---

### `PendingAction` — one-shot follow-up the bot is waiting on

At most **one row per sender** (`senderWaId` is unique). It captures a single thing the bot expects the user to answer next:

- `cancel` — a delete in a DM (no wake word) is stored instead of executed; the bot waits for a `כן` before deleting.
- `awaitTime` — an appointment was created without a time; the bot saved the date and is waiting for the hour. The next message carrying a time fills it in (and flips `Appointment.timeKnown` to `true`); a `כן` re-asks; a "לא"/"אחר כך" leaves it date-only; anything else is handled normally.

`consumePendingAction` reads-and-clears it; expired rows (`expiresAt`) are ignored and swept by the same daily cron.

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `kind` | Action type: `cancel` or `awaitTime` |
| `appointmentId` | Target appointment (to delete, or to set the time on) |
| `summary` | Hebrew description / title echoed back to the user |
| `expiresAt` | After this, the pending action is dead |

## Two gates: env vs database

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  PHONE[Incoming phone number]
  NORM[normalizeIsraeliPhone\n052… → 972…]
  ENV{In ALLOWED_PHONE_NUMBERS\nenv list?}
  DB{Row in FamilyMember?}
  OK[Allowed]
  NO[Rejected Hebrew message]

  PHONE --> NORM --> ENV
  ENV -->|yes| OK
  ENV -->|no| DB
  DB -->|yes| OK
  DB -->|no| NO
```

| Mechanism | When it matters |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **`ALLOWED_PHONE_NUMBERS` env** | **Access list only** — who may log in / use the bot; bootstrap before seed; `railway run` seed source |
| **`FamilyMember` table** | **Source of truth** for names, gender, and stable IDs |

**Format (one env var):** bare comma-separated phones are the norm — name and gender belong to the table.

```env
ALLOWED_PHONE_NUMBERS=972521234567,972529876543
# optional bootstrap form (only fills name/gender when present):
ALLOWED_PHONE_NUMBERS=972521234567:שם:female,972529876543:שם2:male
```

- `phone` only → parses to `displayName = null`, `gender = null`. The seed creates a row with the phone as a **placeholder** name, but **never overwrites** an existing name/gender. The real name arrives from **registration** or a one-time table fill.
- `phone:שם:gender` → optional convenience; seed will set/refresh those fields.
- This is deliberate: a bare-phone env used to clobber real names back to the phone number on every seed — now it can't.

**Seed command:** `npm run prisma:seed` upserts into `FamilyMember` (name/gender only when the env entry supplies them). It does **not** run automatically on every Railway deploy—only `prisma migrate deploy` does.

**One-time name fill:** to set names for existing placeholder rows without putting them in env, run `scripts/seed-family-allowlist.sql` (gitignored; copy from `scripts/seed-family-allowlist.example.sql`) — an idempotent table upsert.

## How clients use the same tables

### Web (JWT)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant SPA
  participant Auth
  participant DB

  SPA->>Auth: POST /api/auth/register phone+password
  Auth->>DB: find FamilyMember by phone
  Auth->>DB: create User linked to familyMemberId
  Auth-->>SPA: JWT + user name/phone/gender from FamilyMember

  SPA->>Auth: GET /api/appointments Bearer JWT
  Auth->>DB: list Appointment + transport User + FamilyMember
```

### WhatsApp (no JWT)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Meta
  participant WH as WhatsappService
  participant FM as FamilyMemberService
  participant DB

  Meta->>WH: webhook text includes חנטריש
  WH->>FM: isAllowed sender phone?
  FM->>DB: FamilyMember or env
  alt not allowed
    WH-->>Meta: Hebrew rejection
  else allowed
    WH->>DB: create/list/query Appointment
    WH-->>Meta: reply text
  end
```

## Migrations & Prisma

| Piece | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Schema truth | `prisma/schema.prisma` |
| SQL history | `prisma/migrations/*` |
| Generated client | `npx prisma generate` |
| Apply locally | `npx prisma migrate dev` |
| Apply production | `npx prisma migrate deploy` (Docker CMD on Railway) |
| Family roster data | `npm run prisma:seed` (manual / `railway run`) |

Important migrations:

- **`20260523120000_family_member_refactor`** — replaced `AllowedPhone` + duplicated `User` profile fields with `FamilyMember` + `User.familyMemberId`.
- **`20260529193000_conversation_memory`** — added `ConversationTurn` + `PendingAction` for WhatsApp conversation memory and destructive-action confirmation.
- **`20260530150000_appointment_time_known`** — added `Appointment.timeKnown` (default `true`) so a date-only booking is distinct from a real 12:00; backfills legacy rows stored at the noon anchor (`12:00 Asia/Jerusalem`) to `false`.

If a migration **fails** on Railway, Prisma blocks further deploys until you fix the DB and run `prisma migrate resolve`. Recovery scripts live under `scripts/complete-family-migration.sql` (see [Deployment](deployment-railway-and-spa.md)).

## Local vs production database

| | Local | Railway |
|---|--------|---------|
| **Host** | `localhost:5434` (Docker) | Postgres plugin URL |
| **Config** | `.env` → `DATABASE_URL` | Service Variables |
| **Family data** | `.env` `ALLOWED_PHONE_NUMBERS` + seed | Same variable on API service + `railway run npm run prisma:seed` |
| **View data** | Prisma Studio, any SQL client | Railway Postgres → Query / Data |

Local and production are **separate databases**. Seeding local does not seed Railway.

---

## Design choices (FAQ)

### Why not one `User` table for everything?

WhatsApp only needs a **phone + name + gender**. Forcing everyone to register would block the bot. Splitting **`FamilyMember`** (identity) from **`User`** (password) matches how the product is used.

### Why is gender only on `FamilyMember`?

Hebrew transport lines and AI prompts need gender per **person**, not per login session. A single place avoids `User.gender` and `AllowedPhone.gender` drifting apart.

### Why `transportUserId` points at `User`, not `FamilyMember`?

Historical and practical: appointments were built around logged-in coordinators. The driver must be a registered user to link cleanly; otherwise the bot keeps plain text in `transportNotes`. Display still resolves the driver’s Hebrew name via `User` → `FamilyMember`.

### What about duplicate phones in the DB?

The app normalizes to `972…` without `+`. Duplicates like `+972…` and `972…` were a common ops issue—seed and cleanup scripts delete `+` rows. Always use normalized numbers in env and SQL.

## Onboarding checklist

1. Start Postgres — [Docker & local database](docker-and-local-database.md)
2. Set `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ALLOWED_PHONE_NUMBERS` in `.env`
3. `npx prisma migrate deploy` then `npm run prisma:seed`
4. Open Prisma Studio or SQL: `SELECT * FROM "FamilyMember";` — expect one row per family member
5. Register in the SPA — creates `User` linked to existing `FamilyMember`
6. Message WhatsApp with **חנטריש** — same allowlist, no `User` required
